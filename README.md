# RAWR! An Extensible Record Library

This library provides anonymous extensible records using GHC 8.0 features, with the following goals/features:

* The syntax should be very close to that of Haskell's record system.
* The library should be simple to use and requires no extra boilerplate to setup.
* There should be minimal runtime overhead and memory footprint.
* The library does not require TemplateHaskell to use.
* It should produce good error messages.
* Minimal dependencies. Currently, it only depends on packages that comes with GHC.

## Documentation

See the [Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rawr/docs/Data-Rawr.html) of `Data.Rawr` on Hackage for a detailed tutorial of this library.
